# Universal Python Function Generator

This repository contains a Python script dave.py that leverages the Ollama language model to generate Python functions on demand. You can describe the input object, the desired action, and the expected output, and the script will attempt to generate a corresponding Python function.

## Key Features

* **Dynamic Function Generation:** Generate Python functions based on natural language descriptions of their purpose.
* **Ollama Integration:** Utilizes the Ollama library and a specified language model (`tomchat-coder4` in the current script) to create the function code.
* **Function Fixing:** Includes functionality to attempt to identify and fix errors in the generated code.
* **Code Cleaning:** Provides functions to remove comments and empty lines from the generated code, improving readability.
* **Testing Framework (Partial):** Contains a `test_function` (commented out in the provided script) that aims to execute and test the generated functions.
* **Example Usage:** Demonstrates how to generate functions for various tasks like calculating sums, checking for prime numbers, calculating factorials, generating passwords, and even creating a simple neural network or resizing images.

## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * **Python 3.6+**
    * **Ollama installed and running:** Follow the installation instructions on the [Ollama website](https://ollama.ai/). Ensure you have the `tomchat-coder4` model (or the model specified in the script) available in Ollama. You can pull it using:
        ```bash
        ollama pull tomchat-coder4
        ```
    * **Ollama Python Library:** Install the Python library for interacting with Ollama:
        ```bash
        pip install ollama
        ```
    * **Optional Dependencies:** Some generated functions might require additional libraries (e.g., `numpy` for the neural network example, `PIL` or `Pillow` for image manipulation). Install these as needed:
        ```bash
        pip install numpy Pillow
        ```

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    cd [repository_name]
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Save the script:** Ensure the provided Python code is saved as a `.py` file (e.g., `universal_functions.py`).

2.  **Run the script:** You can execute the script directly. The example code at the end demonstrates how to use the `generate_function` function.

    ```bash
    python universal_functions.py
    ```

3.  **Using the functions:**

    * **`generate_function(object_repr, action, output)`:** This is the core function. Provide a string describing the input object (`object_repr`), the desired action (`action`), and the expected output type (`output`). It returns the generated Python function code as a string.

        ```python
        import ollama  # Make sure this import is at the top of your script

        def generate_function(object_repr, action, output):
            # ... (rest of your generate_function code) ...
            pass # Replace with your actual function

        object_repr = "a list of strings"
        action = "concatenate all strings in the list with a space in between"
        output = "a single string"
        generated_code = generate_function(object_repr, action, output)
        print(generated_code)
        ```

    * **`fix_function(object_repr, action, function)`:** Takes the same input descriptions as `generate_function` along with a generated function code string. It attempts to identify and fix errors in the provided function.

        ```python
        # Assuming you have a generated function string called 'bad_code'
        fixed_code = fix_function(object_repr, action, bad_code)
        print(fixed_code)
        ```

    * **`remove_comments(code_string)`:** Takes a Python code string and returns a version with comments removed.

        ```python
        cleaned_code = remove_comments(generated_code)
        print(cleaned_code)
        ```

    * **`remove_empty_lines(code)`:** Takes a Python code string and returns a version with empty lines removed.

        ```python
        concise_code = remove_empty_lines(generated_code)
        print(concise_code)
        ```

    * **`test_function(object_repr, action, output, gengen)`:** (Currently commented out in the script) This function was likely intended to generate, execute, and test the generated function with a sample input (`gengen`). You can uncomment and adapt this section for more automated testing.

        ```python
        # Uncomment and modify the following lines in your script:
        # object_repr = "an integer"
        # action = "double the integer"
        # output = "an integer"
        # test_function(object_repr, action, output, 5)
        ```

## Examples

The script itself contains several examples of how to use the `generate_function` to create functions for different tasks:

* Calculating the sum of a list of integers.
* Checking if a number is prime.
* Calculating the factorial of a number.
* Generating a random password.
* Creating a simple neural network.
* Resizing an image.

You can modify or add more examples within the script to explore the capabilities of the function generator.

## Potential Use Cases

* **Rapid Prototyping:** Quickly generate basic utility functions for testing or development.
* **Educational Tool:** Demonstrate how natural language descriptions can be translated into code.
* **Automation:** Automate the creation of simple, repetitive functions based on predefined patterns.
* **Experimentation:** Explore the capabilities of language models in generating code for various tasks.

## Limitations

* **Dependency on Ollama:** Requires Ollama to be installed and running with the specified model.
* **Generated Code Quality:** The quality and correctness of the generated code depend heavily on the language model used and the clarity of the input description. The generated code may require manual review and testing.
* **Error Handling:** While the `fix_function` attempts to correct errors, it may not always be successful.
* **Complexity:** Generating highly complex or domain-specific functions might be challenging.
* **Security:** Be cautious when executing code generated by language models, especially in production environments. Always review the generated code before execution.
